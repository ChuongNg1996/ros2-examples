# This tutorial aimed to show how StaticTransformBroadcaster can be used to publish static transforms. In 
# your real development process you shouldnâ€™t have to write this code yourself and should use the dedicated 
# tf2_ros tool to do so. tf2_ros provides an executable named static_transform_publisher that can be used 
# either as a commandline tool or a node that you can add to your launchfiles.
